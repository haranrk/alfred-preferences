## Usage

Type `2fm` to view the most recent two-factor authentication codes from iMessage messages.

Select a 2FA code and do one of the following:

* Press `<enter>` to copy it to your clipboard
* Press `⌘+<enter>` (command + enter) to copy it to your clipboard and paste it into the active app window using simulated keystrokes
  * Some websites (e.g. Wells Fargo online banking) don't support pasting a 2FA code, so this will instead simulate typing the code
  * In order for this to work, you MUST grant Alfred automation access to `System Events`. If you haven't already done so, you will be prompted to grant access. [See here for more information about Alfred automation.](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/getting-started/permissions/#automation) 
* Press `⌥+<enter>` (option + enter) to copy it to your clipboard and paste it into the active app window using the system paste (similar to pressing `⌘+V`)

## Compatibility

This workflow was developed for use with Alfred 4.
